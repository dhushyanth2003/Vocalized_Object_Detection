Description

This Python script combines computer vision, deep learning, and text-to-speech technologies to perform real-time object detection with distance calculation using a webcam feed. The script uses the Ultralytics YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for detecting various objects in the video stream. As objects are identified, bounding boxes are drawn around them, and essential details such as confidence, class names, and distances are displayed on the frame. The distance to each detected object is calculated based on the known width of the objects, the camera's focal length, and the width of the bounding box. The script then employs the pyttsx3 library to convert the detected object information into audible announcements. These vocalized announcements are triggered only when there are changes in the set of currently detected objects compared to the previous frame, enhancing the user experience. The system operates in a continuous loop until the user exits by pressing the 'q' key, utilizing OpenCV for webcam interaction, real-time visual feedback, and audio output. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive solution for users to receive vocalized information about objects and their distances in real-time through a webcam feed.
